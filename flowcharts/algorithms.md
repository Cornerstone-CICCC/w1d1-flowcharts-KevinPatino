Algorithm excercise 1
    1. Start
    2. input feet and save as a var "lft"
    3. Multiply lft * 30
    4. Result save as a var "LCM"
    5. Print LCM
    6. End

Algorithm excercise 2
    1. Start
    2. Input the width of the rectangle and save as var "W"
    3. Input the length of the rectangle and save as a var "L"
    4. Multiply W * L
    5. Result save as a var "A"
    6. Print A
    7. End

Algorithm excercise 3
    1. Start
    2. Input A, B, C as 3 different numbers
    3. Check IF number A is bigger or equal to B
        4. IF is true, check IF A is bigger or equal to C
            5. IF is true, print A
        6. IF is False, check IF B is bigger or equal to C
            7. IF is true, print B
        8. If is False, print C.
    9. End

Algorithm excercise 4
    1. Start
    2. Input sides of a posible triangle and save as A, B, C
    3. Check IF the result of A + B is bigger than C
        4. IF is true, print "Triangle is possible"
        5. IF is false, print "Triangle is not posible"
    6. End

 Algorithm excercise 5
    1. Start
    2. Imput grade
    3. Check IF grade is bigger or equal to 80%
        4. IF is true, print "A".
        5. If is false, check is grade is bigger or equal to 60%
            6. IF is true, print "B"
        7. IF is false, check is grade is bigger or equal to 40%
            8. If is true, print "C"
        9. IF is false, check is grade is smaller than 40%
            10. IF is true, print "No grade"
        11. IF is false, print "Enter a grade between 0 and 100%", then return to 2nd step
    12. End
